## Introduction

The Stone, Paper, Scissors Game with Certificate Generation project is a Python-based implementation of the classic game where players choose between stone, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly selects one of these options, and the winner is determined based on traditional game rules:

- Stone crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Stone

In addition to the game mechanics, this project introduces a unique feature: generating a personalized certificate using the `fpdf` library. This certificate, generated upon the game’s completion, provides a fun way to celebrate the player’s participation and the outcome of the game. This feature not only enhances user experience but also adds a touch of personalization to a classic game.

## Features

### Game Mechanics

The core feature of this project is the classic Stone, Paper, Scissors game. Players can:
- **Play against the computer**: Engage in a simple yet entertaining game where you pit your choices against a computer-generated move.
- **Determine the winner**: The game evaluates the choices and declares a winner based on standard rules.

### Certificate Generation

After the game concludes, a certificate is generated that includes:
- **Player’s Name**: Personalized to each participant.
- **Game Outcome**: Reflects whether the player won, lost, or tied with the computer.

The certificate is created using the `fpdf` library and saved as a PDF file, providing a tangible and shareable record of the game’s results.

## Libraries Used

### `random`

The `random` library is used to simulate the computer’s moves. It ensures that each game is unpredictable and fair by randomly selecting between stone, paper, or scissors.

### `fpdf`

The `fpdf` library is employed to create the PDF certificate. It allows for:
- **Customization**: Incorporate text and styling into the PDF document.
- **File Generation**: Save the game result as a PDF file that can be shared or printed.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with the Stone, Paper, Scissors Game, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stone-paper-scissors-game.git
```

Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username or the relevant repository path.

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd stone-paper-scissors-game
```

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have a `requirements.txt` file, manually install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install fpdf
```

## How to Use

Follow these steps to play the game and generate a certificate:

1. **Run the Python Script**

   Execute the script by running:

   ```bash
   python project.py
   ```

2. **Enter Your Name**

   When prompted, enter your name. This will be used in the generated certificate.

3. **Make Your Choice**

   Select one of the following options:
   - Stone
   - Paper
   - Scissors

4. **View the Result**

   The game will display the result of your choice versus the computer’s choice and declare the winner.

5. **Receive Your Certificate**

   After the game concludes, a PDF certificate will be created. This file will include your name and the outcome of the game, and it will be saved in the project directory.

## Code Overview

### Main Script (`project.py`)

The `project.py` file contains the main logic for the game. Here’s a brief overview of its components:

- **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries (`random` and `fpdf`).
- **Game Logic**: Functions to handle player input, generate computer moves, and determine the winner.
- **Certificate Generation**: Code to create and save a PDF certificate using `fpdf`.

### Game Flow

1. **Initialization**: Set up game options and user prompts.
2. **User Interaction**: Capture and validate user input.
3. **Computer Move**: Randomly generate the computer’s move.
4. **Determine Winner**: Compare moves and decide the winner.
5. **Generate Certificate**: Create a personalized certificate with the game outcome.

## Customization

You can customize the Stone, Paper, Scissors Game in various ways:

- **Game Options**: Modify the choices or add new rules.
- **Certificate Design**: Adjust the layout, fonts, or additional details on the certificate.
- **Game Messages**: Change the text or add more interactive elements to enhance user experience.

To make changes, edit the `project.py` file and adjust the relevant sections according to your preferences.
